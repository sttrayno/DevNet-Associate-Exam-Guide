# DevNet Associate Exam Guide

The following guide outlines collection of resources and explains some typical jargon you may hear around the DevNet associate exam.

## What is DevNet

DevNet is the single resource for all Developer resources at Cisco. Whether you're a seasoned developer or work in infrastructure and looking to pick up more skills in software this is the main resource for all things developing on top of Cisco. To help people on this journey, Cisco have included the DevNet content in their certifcation tracks as of Feburary 2020, this document will give you the lowdown on how to start preparing for them.

## I'm new to this, where should I sart

One of the best resources if you're familair with Cisco technologies but just getting started with DevNet is a video series by Hank Preston called the [Learn network programmability basics course](https://developer.cisco.com/video/net-prog-basics/). This is a great place to start if you're new to this and looking to understand whats involved.

## Ok, whats the exam format?

The Devnet certification track has a number of levels. DevNet Associate which is equivalent to CCNA (this requires you to pass one exam 900-201), DevNet Professional, which is equivalent to CCNP level and DevNet specialists for people looking to specialise in a single area (DevOps, Enterprise Automation, DC Automation, IoT, Collaboration etc). Passing the DevNet specialist exams gets you a DevNet specialist certifcation in that area. To pass the DevNet professional level you must have at least one of these exams and the DevNet Core exam 900-301.

If you're new the best place to start is probably DevNet associate. The exam consists of 100 Questions and candidates have 120 minutes to complete. Exam questions include multiple choice, drag and drop and fill in the blank. There are no simulations where you as a candidate are expected to code, however fill in the blank question types may test similar knowledge for example to complete a Python code exerpt.

## Blueprint

If you’re going for DevNet Associate this should one of your first starting points. This blueprint outlines the skills of the minimum qualified candidate and the skills that will be tested in the exam. Questions for the exam are wrote against this blueprint so this is the best place to understand what areas you need to focus on and cover so you are prepared for the exam.

Every Cisco exam has a blueprint so it’s very good practice to review this and benchmark your own knowledge against this.
