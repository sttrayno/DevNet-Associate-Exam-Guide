# DevNet Associate Exam Guide

The following guide outlines collection of resources and explains some typical jargon you may hear around the DevNet associate exam and provides an introduction to the world of DevNet for those who have potentially heard about the new certifications but aren't sure where to start.

## What is DevNet

DevNet is the single resource for all Developer resources at Cisco. Whether you're a seasoned developer or work in infrastructure and looking to pick up more skills in software this is the main resource for all things developing on top of Cisco. To help people on this journey, Cisco have included the DevNet content in their certifcation tracks as of Feburary 2020, this document will give you the lowdown on how to start preparing for them.

## I'm new to this, where should I sart

One of the best resources if you're familair with Cisco technologies but just getting started with DevNet is a video series by Hank Preston called the [Learn network programmability basics course](https://developer.cisco.com/video/net-prog-basics/). This is a great place to start if you're new to this and looking to understand whats involved.

## Ok, whats the exam format?

The Devnet certification track has a number of levels. DevNet Associate which is equivalent to CCNA (this requires you to pass one exam 900-201), DevNet Professional, which is equivalent to CCNP level and DevNet specialists for people looking to specialise in a single area (DevOps, Enterprise Automation, DC Automation, IoT, Collaboration etc). Passing the DevNet specialist exams gets you a DevNet specialist certifcation in that area. To pass the DevNet professional level you must have at least one of these exams and the DevNet Core exam 900-301.

If you're new the best place to start is probably DevNet associate. The exam consists of 100 Questions and candidates have 120 minutes to complete. Exam questions include multiple choice, drag and drop and fill in the blank. There are no simulations where you as a candidate are expected to code, however fill in the blank question types may test similar knowledge for example to complete a Python code exerpt.

## Blueprint

If you’re going for DevNet Associate this should one of your first starting points. This blueprint outlines the skills of the minimum qualified candidate and the skills that will be tested in the exam. Questions for the exam are wrote against this blueprint so this is the best place to understand what areas you need to focus on and cover so you are prepared for the exam.

Every Cisco exam has a blueprint so it’s very good practice to review this and benchmark your own knowledge against this.

Here are some Blueprints from the Cisco Software track

## Self paced video learning

You have a few options for self paced video content and it's available from all the usual sources. This isn't an exhaustive list but these are some of the most popular options that I have personally came across and heard good things about included below:

Pluralsight - [This highly rated course by Nick Russo](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/cisco-certified-devnet-associate-devasc-200-901)

CBT Nuggets - [A comprehensive set of videos from CBT Nuggets](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/certification-playlist/cisco/devnet-associate)

Cisco Learning Library - [Official DevNet Associate Fundamentals course from Cisco Learning Library](https://developer.cisco.com/certification/fundamentals/)

## Books

For those who like to use a book for certifcation study. There is also a book from CiscoPress specifically for the DEVASC exam. The hard copy is officially released however availability is limited currently but can be ordered. The ebook version is scheduled to be released in July.

[Soft Copy](https://www.ciscopress.com/store/cisco-certified-devnet-associate-devasc-200-901-official-9780136677338)

## Labs

Hands on learning is a great way to solidify some of the knowledge tested in the exam as candidates are expected to have applied knowledge. Some options for hands on learning include:

* [DevNet Learning Labs](https://developer.cisco.com/startnow/): Selection of curated content from DevNet

* [Network Automation Workshop](https://github.com/sttrayno/Network-Automation-Tooling): A collection of hands on labs from the comminity which cover many of the topics included in the exam.

Both options above you can use against your own environment or you can use the [DevNet sandbox](developer.cisco.com/sandbox) to have a physical environment you can use the above labs.
